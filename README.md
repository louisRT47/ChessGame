## Introduction
Dive into the world of chess with an exciting 3D or 2D Chess Game, crafted using Qt Creator. 

## Installation
To explore this project for inspiration or learning, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on Qt Creator.
2. Download the project files.
3. Log in to your account, click 'Open Project,' and select the file with a .pro extension.
4. Before running the project, ensure the following packages are installed: libva-dev and qtmultimedia5-dev.

For Ubuntu or similar Linux distributions, open a terminal and enter:
